# .Net Standard Network Library (WIP)

A library intended to be a strong backbone for future developments. Aim is to achieve highest performance with reasonable memory requirements.

No locks, no extra allocations, minimum GC pressure, automatic concurrency.

Supported Frameworks .Net Standard 2.0+.

Not production ready, everything is subject to change. Mostly for experimental purposes yet.

So far we have:
- Regular Tcp Sever - Client send and recieves pure bytes, used as base, can be used standalone.
- Byte Message Server - Client for sending and receiving atomic messages with 4 byte length header.
- Ssl Client Server model using .Net built in Ssl stream supporting atomic Byte message protocol.
- A custom Ssl client - server with custom key exchange and AES, only for experimental purposes. This may extend into secure UDP
- Simple Udp Server-Client work in progress, to be returned here. 

This project will be extended to implement Protobuff, HTTP.


# Documentation
TODO
Development is in progress, design is not finalised.

Helicopter view design involves:
- SocketAsyncEventArgs based Tcp Server-Client.
- Contigious send and receive buffers for the reduction of GC overheads due to WSA pinning.
- A message queue system where the messages are queued if the async operation is pending.
- Messages are dequeued and processed by the worker thread which comes from operation completion callback.

# Sample Code
```c#
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            ByteMessageTcpServer server = new ByteMessageTcpServer(20008, maxClients:100);
            server.OnBytesReceived += ServerBytesReceived;
            server.StartServer();

            ByteMessageTcpClient client = new ByteMessageTcpClient();
            client.OnBytesReceived += ClientBytesReceived;
            client.Connect("127.0.0.1", 20008);

            client.SendAsync(ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes("Hello I'm a client! this message will reach you atomically"));
            Console.ReadLine();

            void ClientBytesReceived(byte[] bytes, int offset, int count)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetString(bytes, offset, count));
            }

            void ServerBytesReceived(Guid guid, byte[] bytes, int offset, int count)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetString(bytes, offset, count));
                server.SendBytesToClient(guid, ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes("Hello I'm the server I got your message"));
            }
        }
 ```
```Console
output:
Hello I'm a client! this message will reach you atomically
Hello I'm the server I got your message
```
# Benchmarks
Benchmarks are executed in personal laptop with i7 8750H. This section will be updated.
## TCP ByteMessage Server
TCP Byte Message Server- Client are sending and receiving byte messages identified by 4 byte header.
Benchmark is done by parallely requesting to the server by N clients with M Messages, and getting a response for each message.
The final message is a special one to determine the timestamp of last response recieved by client.
Byte header is not included on data transfer rate.

I will publish my results with more tests and represent them with graphs in the future. so far this it

## Udp 
Udp Server Client Sends and Receives messages directly without buffering.
Server Registers a client by message remote endpoint info, hence client has to send a message first to register on server. Thats how i call them "client".
This benchmark is done by using 2 Threads where first one
is allocated to clients and second is to server. We start the 2 threads at same tÄ±me and both sends messages to each other parallely. There is no Echo.

#Clients:  1,000 | #Messages: 500K | Msg size: 32000 || Server Socket Send Receive buffer Sizes :128000000

- Total Message Server received: 501000.
- Total Message Clients received: 500000.
- Total Time Clients: 21951
- Total Time Server: 34327
- Total Sucessfull Data Transfer Rate Clients: 728.89Mbytes/s
- Total Sucessfull Data Transfer Rate Server: 467.03 Mbytes/s
